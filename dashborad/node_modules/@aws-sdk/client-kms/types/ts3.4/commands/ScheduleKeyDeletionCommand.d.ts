/**
 * <p>Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). You may provide a waiting period,
 *       specified in days, before deletion occurs. If you do not provide a waiting period, the default
 *       period of 30 days is used. When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes
 *       to <code>PendingDeletion</code>. Before the waiting period ends, you can use <a>CancelKeyDeletion</a> to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting period
 *       ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that
 *       refer to it.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is
 *         deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable. To prevent the use of a
 *         CMK without deleting it, use <a>DisableKey</a>.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>If you schedule deletion of a CMK from a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key store</a>, when the waiting period
 *       expires, <code>ScheduleKeyDeletion</code> deletes the CMK from AWS KMS. Then AWS KMS makes a best
 *       effort to delete the key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need
 *       to manually <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key">delete the orphaned key
 *         material</a> from the cluster and its backups.</p>
 *          <p>You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about scheduling a CMK for deletion, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html">Deleting Customer Master Keys</a> in the
 *       <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For
 * details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html">How Key State Affects Use
 * of a Customer Master Key</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
