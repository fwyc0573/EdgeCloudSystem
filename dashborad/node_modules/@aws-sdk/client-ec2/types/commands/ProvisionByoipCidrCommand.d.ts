/**
 * <p>Provisions an IPv4 or IPv6 address range for use with your AWS resources through bring your own IP
 *          addresses (BYOIP) and creates a corresponding address pool. After the address range is
 *          provisioned, it is ready to be advertised using <a>AdvertiseByoipCidr</a>.</p>
 *          <p>AWS verifies that you own the address range and are authorized to advertise it.
 *          You must ensure that the address range is registered to you and that you created an
 *          RPKI ROA to authorize Amazon ASNs 16509 and 14618 to advertise the address range.
 *          For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html">Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>Provisioning an address range is an asynchronous operation, so the call returns immediately,
 *          but the address range is not ready to use until its status changes from <code>pending-provision</code>
 *          to <code>provisioned</code>. To monitor the status of an address range, use <a>DescribeByoipCidrs</a>.
 *          To allocate an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool, use <a>AllocateAddress</a>
 *          with either the specific address from the address pool or the ID of the address pool.</p>
