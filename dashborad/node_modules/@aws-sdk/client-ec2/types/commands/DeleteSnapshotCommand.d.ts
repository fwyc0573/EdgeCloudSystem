/**
 * <p>Deletes the specified snapshot.</p>
 *          <p>When you make periodic snapshots of a volume, the snapshots are incremental, and only the
 *       blocks on the device that have changed since your last snapshot are saved in the new snapshot.
 *       When you delete a snapshot, only the data not needed for any other snapshot is removed. So
 *       regardless of which prior snapshots have been deleted, all active snapshots will have access
 *       to all the information needed to restore the volume.</p>
 *          <p>You cannot delete a snapshot of the root device of an EBS volume used by a registered AMI.
 *       You must first de-register the AMI before you can delete the snapshot.</p>
 *          <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-deleting-snapshot.html">Deleting an Amazon EBS snapshot</a> in the
 *         <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
