 *
 *         <p>Flow log data for a monitored network interface is recorded as flow log records, which are log events
 *             consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow. For more information, see

 *         <p>When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log records are published to a log group, and each network
 *             interface has a unique log stream in the log group. When publishing to Amazon S3, flow log records for all
