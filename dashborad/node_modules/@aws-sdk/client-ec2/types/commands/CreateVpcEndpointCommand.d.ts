/**
 * <p>Creates a VPC endpoint for a specified service. An endpoint enables you to create a
 *             private connection between your VPC and the service. The service may be provided by AWS,
 *             an AWS Marketplace Partner, or another AWS account. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html">VPC Endpoints</a> in
 *             the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <p>A <code>gateway</code> endpoint serves as a target for a route in your route table for
 *             traffic destined for the AWS service. You can specify an endpoint policy to attach to
 *             the endpoint, which will control access to the service from your VPC. You can also
 *             specify the VPC route tables that use the endpoint.</p>
 *         <p>An <code>interface</code> endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that
 *             serves as an endpoint for communicating with the specified service. You can specify the
 *             subnets in which to create an endpoint, and the security groups to associate with the
 *             endpoint network interface.</p>
 *         <p>A <code>GatewayLoadBalancer</code> endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that serves an endpoint for communicating with a Gateway Load Balancer that you've configured as a VPC endpoint service.</p>
 *         <p>Use <a>DescribeVpcEndpointServices</a> to get a list of supported
 *             services.</p>
