/**
 * <p>Assigns one or more secondary private IP addresses to the specified network interface.</p>
 *         <p>You can specify one or more specific secondary IP addresses, or you can specify the number
 *             of secondary IP addresses to be automatically assigned within the subnet's CIDR block range.
 *             The number of secondary IP addresses that you can assign to an instance varies by instance type.
 *             For information about instance types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html">Instance Types</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>. For more information about
 *             Elastic IP addresses, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html">Elastic IP Addresses</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <p>When you move a secondary private IP address to another network interface, any Elastic IP address
 *             that is associated with the IP address is also moved.</p>
 *         <p>Remapping an IP address is an asynchronous operation. When you move an IP address from one network
 *             interface to another, check <code>network/interfaces/macs/mac/local-ipv4s</code> in the instance
 *             metadata to confirm that the remapping is complete.</p>
 *         <p>You must specify either the IP addresses or the IP address count in the request.</p>
