/**
 * <p>Creates a route in a route table within a VPC.</p>
 *          <p>You must specify one of the following targets: internet gateway or virtual private
 * 			gateway, NAT instance, NAT gateway, VPC peering connection, network interface, egress-only internet gateway, or transit gateway.</p>
 *          <p>When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with the most specific match.
 *             For example, traffic is destined for the IPv4 address <code>192.0.2.3</code>, and the
 *             route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:</p>
 * 			      <ul>
 *             <li>
 * 					          <p>
 *                   <code>192.0.2.0/24</code> (goes to some target A)</p>
 * 				        </li>
 *             <li>
 * 					          <p>
 *                   <code>192.0.2.0/28</code> (goes to some target B)</p>
 * 				        </li>
 *          </ul>
 * 		       <p>Both routes apply to the traffic destined for <code>192.0.2.3</code>. However, the second route
 * 				in the list covers a smaller number of IP addresses and is therefore more specific,
 * 				so we use that route to determine where to target the traffic.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about route tables, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html">Route Tables</a> in the
 *          <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
