/**
 * <p>Sends a diagnostic interrupt to the specified Amazon EC2 instance to trigger a
 * 			<i>kernel panic</i> (on Linux instances), or a
 * 			<i>blue screen</i>/<i>stop error</i> (on Windows
 * 			instances). For instances based on Intel and AMD processors, the interrupt is
 * 			received as a <i>non-maskable interrupt</i> (NMI).</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>In general, the operating system crashes and reboots when a kernel panic or stop
 * 			error is triggered. The operating system can also be configured to perform diagnostic
 * 			tasks, such as generating a memory dump file, loading a secondary kernel, or
 * 			obtaining a call trace.</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>Before sending a diagnostic interrupt to your instance, ensure that its operating
 * 			system is configured to perform the required diagnostic tasks.</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>For more information about configuring your operating system to generate a crash dump
 * 			when a kernel panic or stop error occurs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html">Send a diagnostic interrupt</a> (Linux instances) or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html">Send a Diagnostic Interrupt</a> (Windows instances).</p>
