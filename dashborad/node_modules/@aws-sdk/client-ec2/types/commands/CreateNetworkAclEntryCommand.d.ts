/**
 * <p>Creates an entry (a rule) in a network ACL with the specified rule number. Each network ACL has a set of numbered ingress rules
 * 		        and a separate set of numbered egress rules. When determining whether a packet should be allowed in or out of a subnet associated
 * 		        with the ACL, we process the entries in the ACL according to the rule numbers, in ascending order. Each network ACL has a set of
 * 		        ingress rules and a separate set of egress rules.</p>
 * 		       <p>We recommend that you leave room between the rule numbers (for example, 100, 110, 120, ...), and not number them one right after the
 * 		        other (for example, 101, 102, 103, ...). This makes it easier to add a rule between existing ones without having to renumber the rules.</p>
 * 		       <p>After you add an entry, you can't modify it; you must either replace it, or create an entry and delete the old one.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about network ACLs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_ACLs.html">Network ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
