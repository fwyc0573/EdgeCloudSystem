/**
 * <p>Describes the specified instances or all instances.</p>
 *         <p>If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only the specified instances.
 *             If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those instances that meet the filter criteria.
 *             If you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes information for all instances,
 *             which can affect performance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation
 *             returns quickly and successfully.</p>
 *         <p>If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you
 *             specify an instance that you do not own, it is not included in the output.</p>
 *         <p>Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is
 *             usually less than one hour.</p>
 *         <p>If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing
 *             a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected zone, or do
 *             not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you describe instances and
 *             specify only instance IDs that are in an unaffected zone, the call works
 *             normally.</p>
