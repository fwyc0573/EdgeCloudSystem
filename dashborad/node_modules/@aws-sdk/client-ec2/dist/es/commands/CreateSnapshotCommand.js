/**
 * <p>Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can use snapshots for
 *       backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and to save data before shutting down an
 *       instance.</p>
 *          <p>When a snapshot is created, any AWS Marketplace product codes that are associated with the
 *       source volume are propagated to the snapshot.</p>
 *          <p>You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only
 *       capture data that has been written to your EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is
 *       issued; this might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating
 *       system. If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your
 *       snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you
 *       should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then
 *       remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your
 *       volume while the snapshot status is <code>pending</code>.</p>
 *          <p>To create a snapshot for EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the
 *       instance before taking the snapshot.</p>
 *          <p>Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted. Volumes that
 *       are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes
 *       and any associated snapshots always remain protected.</p>
 *          <p>You can tag your snapshots during creation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html">Tagging your Amazon EC2
 *         resources</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
