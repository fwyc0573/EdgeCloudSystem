/**
 * <p>Modifies the specified Spot Fleet request.</p>
 *          <p>You can only modify a Spot Fleet request of type <code>maintain</code>.</p>
 *          <p>While the Spot Fleet request is being modified, it is in the <code>modifying</code> state.</p>
 *          <p>To scale up your Spot Fleet, increase its target capacity. The Spot Fleet launches the
 *             additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the Spot Fleet
 *             request. If the allocation strategy is <code>lowestPrice</code>, the Spot Fleet launches
 *             instances using the Spot Instance pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy
 *             is <code>diversified</code>, the Spot Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot
 *             Instance pools. If the allocation strategy is <code>capacityOptimized</code>, Spot Fleet
 *             launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances
 *             that are launching.</p>
 *          <p>To scale down your Spot Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the Spot Fleet
 *             cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the
 *             Spot Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the
 *             new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is <code>lowestPrice</code>, the Spot
 *             Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation
 *             strategy is <code>capacityOptimized</code>, the Spot Fleet terminates the instances in
 *             the Spot Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation
 *             strategy is <code>diversified</code>, the Spot Fleet terminates instances across the
 *             Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the Spot Fleet keep the fleet
 *             at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you
 *             terminate manually.</p>
 *          <p>If you are finished with your Spot Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can set the
 *        target capacity to 0.</p>
