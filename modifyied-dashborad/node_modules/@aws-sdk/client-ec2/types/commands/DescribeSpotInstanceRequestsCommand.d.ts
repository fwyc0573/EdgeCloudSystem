/**
 * <p>Describes the specified Spot Instance requests.</p>
 *          <p>You can use <code>DescribeSpotInstanceRequests</code> to find a
 * 		running Spot Instance by examining the response. If the status of
 * 		the Spot Instance is <code>fulfilled</code>, the instance ID
 * 		appears in the response and contains the identifier of the instance.
 * 		Alternatively, you can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInstances">DescribeInstances</a> with a filter to
 * 		look for instances where the instance lifecycle is <code>spot</code>.</p>
 *         <p>We recommend that you set <code>MaxResults</code> to a value between 5 and 1000 to
 *             limit the number of results returned. This paginates the output, which makes the list
 *             more manageable and returns the results faster. If the list of results exceeds your
 *                 <code>MaxResults</code> value, then that number of results is returned along with a
 *                 <code>NextToken</code> value that can be passed to a subsequent
 *                 <code>DescribeSpotInstanceRequests</code> request to retrieve the remaining
 *             results.</p>
 * 	        <p>Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they are canceled and their instances
 *             are terminated.</p>
