/**
 * <p>Creates a new Capacity Reservation with the specified attributes.</p>
 * 		       <p>Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. This
 * 			gives you the flexibility to selectively add capacity reservations and still get the Regional RI discounts for that usage.
 * 			By creating Capacity Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to Amazon EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it.
 * 			For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html">Capacity Reservations</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>Your request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if Amazon EC2 does not have sufficient capacity to
 * 			fulfill the request. If your request fails due to Amazon EC2 capacity constraints, either try
 * 			again at a later time, try in a different Availability Zone, or request a smaller
 * 			capacity reservation. If your application is flexible across instance types and sizes,
 * 			try to create a Capacity Reservation with different instance attributes.</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>Your request could also fail if the requested quantity exceeds your On-Demand Instance
 * 			limit for the selected instance type. If your request fails due to limit constraints,
 * 			increase your On-Demand Instance limit for the required instance type and try again. For
 * 			more information about increasing your instance limits, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html">Amazon EC2 Service
 * 				Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
