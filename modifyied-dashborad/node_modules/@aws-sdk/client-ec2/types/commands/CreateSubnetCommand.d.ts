/**
 * <p>Creates a subnet in a specified VPC.</p>
 *         <p>You must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet. After you create a subnet, you
 *             can't change its CIDR block. The allowed block size is between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP
 *             addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP addresses). The CIDR block must not overlap with the
 *             CIDR block of an existing subnet in the VPC.</p>
 *         <p>If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can create a subnet with an
 *             IPv6 CIDR block that uses a /64 prefix length. </p>
 *         <important>
 *             <p>AWS reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet's CIDR
 *                 block. They're not available for use.</p>
 *         </important>
 *         <p>If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a
 *             logical router in the middle.</p>
 *         <p>When you stop an instance in a subnet, it retains its private IPv4 address. It's
 *             therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but
 *             no remaining IP addresses available.</p>
 *         <p>For more information about subnets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html">Your VPC and Subnets</a> in the
 *                 <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
