/**
 * <p>Modifies the specified EC2 Fleet.</p>
 *          <p>You can only modify an EC2 Fleet request of type <code>maintain</code>.</p>
 *          <p>While the EC2 Fleet is being modified, it is in the <code>modifying</code> state.</p>
 *          <p>To scale up your EC2 Fleet, increase its target capacity. The EC2 Fleet launches the additional
 *          Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the EC2 Fleet request. If the allocation
 *          strategy is <code>lowest-price</code>, the EC2 Fleet launches instances using the Spot Instance
 *          pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is <code>diversified</code>, the
 *          EC2 Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot Instance pools. If the allocation strategy
 *          is <code>capacity-optimized</code>, EC2 Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal
 *          capacity for the number of instances that are launching.</p>
 *          <p>To scale down your EC2 Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the EC2 Fleet cancels any open
 *          requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the EC2 Fleet terminate Spot
 *          Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the
 *          allocation strategy is <code>lowest-price</code>, the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances with
 *          the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is <code>capacity-optimized</code>,
 *          the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances in the Spot Instance pools that have the least available
 *          Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation strategy is <code>diversified</code>, the EC2 Fleet terminates
 *          instances across the Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the EC2 Fleet keep
 *          the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or
 *          that you terminate manually.</p>
 *          <p>If you are finished with your EC2 Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can set the
 *          target capacity to 0.</p>
