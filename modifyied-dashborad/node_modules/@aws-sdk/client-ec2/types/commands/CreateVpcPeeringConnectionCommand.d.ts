 * <p>Requests a VPC peering connection between two VPCs: a requester VPC that you own and

 * 			VPC and accepter VPC cannot have overlapping CIDR blocks.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Limitations and rules apply to a VPC peering connection. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-basics.html#vpc-peering-limitations">limitations</a> section in the <i>VPC Peering Guide</i>.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>The owner of the accepter VPC must accept the peering request to activate the peering
 *             connection. The VPC peering connection request expires after 7 days, after which it
 *             cannot be accepted or rejected.</p>
 *          <p>If you create a VPC peering connection request between VPCs with overlapping CIDR
 *             blocks, the VPC peering connection has a status of <code>failed</code>.</p>
