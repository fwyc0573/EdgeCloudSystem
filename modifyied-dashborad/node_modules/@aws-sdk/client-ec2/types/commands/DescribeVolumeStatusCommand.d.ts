/**
 * <p>Describes the status of the specified volumes. Volume status provides the result of the
 *       checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the performance of your
 *       volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's
 *       underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue,
 *       after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events
 *       notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in
 *       response to the event.</p>
 *          <p>The <code>DescribeVolumeStatus</code> operation provides the following information about
 *       the specified volumes:</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <i>Status</i>: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible
 *       values are <code>ok</code>, <code>impaired</code> , <code>warning</code>, or
 *         <code>insufficient-data</code>. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is
 *         <code>ok</code>. If the check fails, the overall status is <code>impaired</code>. If the
 *       status is <code>insufficient-data</code>, then the checks might still be taking place on your
 *       volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume
 *       status, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html">Monitoring the status of your volumes</a> in the
 *       <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <i>Events</i>: Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you to
 *       take action. For example, if your volume returns an <code>impaired</code> status, then the
 *       volume event might be <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>. This means that your volume
 *       has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and
 *       might have inconsistent data.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <i>Actions</i>: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an
 *       event. For example, if the status of the volume is <code>impaired</code> and the volume event
 *       shows <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>, then the action shows
 *         <code>enable-volume-io</code>. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for
 *       the volume by calling the <a>EnableVolumeIO</a> action and then check the volume
 *       for data consistency.</p>
 *          <p>Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state.
 *       Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the <code>error</code> state (for
 *       example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)</p>
