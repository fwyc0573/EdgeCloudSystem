/**
 * <p>Shuts down the specified instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an
 *             instance more than once, each call succeeds. </p>
 *         <p>If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a
 *             single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated.</p>
 *         <p>Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one
 *             hour).</p>
 *         <p>By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance
 *             launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.</p>
 *         <p>You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate
 *             instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop it or
 *             terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other
 *             devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached
 *             EBS volumes with the <code>DeleteOnTermination</code> block device mapping parameter set
 *             to <code>true</code> are automatically deleted. For more information about the
 *             differences between stopping and terminating instances, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html">Instance lifecycle</a>
 *             in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
