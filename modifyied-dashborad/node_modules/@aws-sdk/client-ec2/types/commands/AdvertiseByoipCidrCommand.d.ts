/**
 * <p>Advertises an IPv4 or IPv6 address range that is provisioned for use with your AWS resources through

 *          <p>You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different
 *          address ranges each time.</p>
 *          <p>We recommend that you stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR from other locations when you advertise
 *          it from AWS. To minimize down time, you can configure your AWS resources to use an address from a
 *          BYOIP CIDR before it is advertised, and then simultaneously stop advertising it from the current
 *          location and start advertising it through AWS.</p>
 *          <p>It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses starts routing to AWS
 *          because of BGP propagation delays.</p>
 *          <p>To stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR, use <a>WithdrawByoipCidr</a>.</p>
