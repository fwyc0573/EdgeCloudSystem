/**
 * <p>Creates a VPN connection between an existing virtual private gateway or transit gateway and a
 *             customer gateway. The supported connection type is <code>ipsec.1</code>.</p>
 *         <p>The response includes information that you need to give to your network administrator
 *             to configure your customer gateway.</p>
 *         <important>
 *             <p>We strongly recommend that you use HTTPS when calling this operation because the
 *                 response contains sensitive cryptographic information for configuring your customer
 *                 gateway device.</p>
 *         </important>
 *         <p>If you decide to shut down your VPN connection for any reason and later create a new
 *             VPN connection, you must reconfigure your customer gateway with the new information
 *             returned from this call.</p>
 *         <p>This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon
 *             EC2 doesn't return an error.</p>
 *         <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html">AWS Site-to-Site VPN</a> in the <i>AWS Site-to-Site VPN
 *                 User Guide</i>.</p>
