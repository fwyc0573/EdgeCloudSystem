/**
 * <p>Creates a security group.</p>
 *          <p>A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.
 *          For more information, see
 * 				<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html">Amazon EC2 Security Groups</a> in
 * 				the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i> and
 * 				<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html">Security Groups for Your VPC</a> in the
 * 				<i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>When you create a security group, you specify a friendly name of your choice. You can have a security group for use in EC2-Classic with the same name as a security group for use in a VPC. However, you can't have two security groups for use in EC2-Classic with the same name or two security groups for use in a VPC with the same name.</p>
 *          <p>You have a default security group for use in EC2-Classic and a default security group for use in your VPC. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into the appropriate default security group. A default security group includes a default rule that grants instances unrestricted network access to each other.</p>
 *          <p>You can add or remove rules from your security groups using
 * 					<a>AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress</a>,
 * 					<a>AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress</a>,
 * 					<a>RevokeSecurityGroupIngress</a>, and
 * 					<a>RevokeSecurityGroupEgress</a>.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about VPC security group limits, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html">Amazon VPC Limits</a>.</p>
