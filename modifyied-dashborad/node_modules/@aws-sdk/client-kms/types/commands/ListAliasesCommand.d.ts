/**
 * <p>Gets a list of aliases in the caller's AWS account and region. You cannot list aliases in

 *          <p>By default, the ListAliases command returns all aliases in the account and region. To get
 *       only the aliases that point to a particular customer master key (CMK), use the
 *         <code>KeyId</code> parameter.</p>
 *          <p>The <code>ListAliases</code> response can include aliases that you created and associated
 *       with your customer managed CMKs, and aliases that AWS created and associated with AWS managed
 *       CMKs in your account. You can recognize AWS aliases because their names have the format
 *         <code>aws/<service-name></code>, such as <code>aws/dynamodb</code>.</p>
 *          <p>The response might also include aliases that have no <code>TargetKeyId</code> field. These
 *       are predefined aliases that AWS has created but has not yet associated with a CMK. Aliases
 *       that AWS creates in your account, including predefined aliases, do not count against your
